The breach we worked on was the stuxnet virus. It would spread around the world and check if it was at a certain control system. if it was not it wouldn't do anything, but if it was it would copy the normal display info, and display normal info while destroying centrifuges.

The worm was an attack on iranian nuclear facilities, designed to destroy centrifuges to slow down their nuclear weapon development.

The flaws were that they inserted a usb drive into sensitive control systems.

they probably don't insert usb drives into control systems anymore.
